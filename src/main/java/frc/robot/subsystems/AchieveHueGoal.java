/*
 * Example of a subsystem composed only of a goal wrapped in its
 * implementer class to achieve that goal.
 * 
 * Note that this is a simple contrived example based on a PID controller.
 * There are better ways to do PID controller entirely within a subsystem.
 * Rarely would a resource need to escape any perceived limitations of the
 * command based subsystem architecture and this is no exception.
 * 
 * This example uses the Xbox right trigger (injected from RobotContainer)
 * to set a goal of a position on the color wheel displayed on the LEDs.
 * The PID is tuned to slowly converge on the requested color.
