/*
 * Example of a subsystem that is a (PID) controller to achieve a goal (setpoint).
 * 
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT:
 * Some teams use the structure of a (perpetually, possibly) running system (class) that is
 * self-contained and periodically updated within itself. No commands are used to calculate or
 * schedule calculations. It responds to commands only to accept the goal (setpoint).
 * 
 * That scheme might not be fully in the spirit of command-based so this example is not encouraging
 * that usage.
 * 
 * A suggestion by CD @Amicus1 for those against using commands except to set the goal:
 * If this is a verbosity of code issue, I suggest writing the logic as a private subsystem method
 * and exposing it as a command factory.
