/**
 * Display a random color signal periodically and don't reuse the same color too soon (if reasonably
 * possible).
 *
 * <p>This is a FSM that depends on the current state, the transition event trigger, and the
 * historical previous states.
 *
 * <p>This demonstrates a command that calls another command upon completion by setting up a
 * trigger. This demonstrates accessing historical data to determine the next state. This
 * demonstrates using persistent data to periodically refresh outputs past the completion of this
 * command. This demonstrates running a command periodically based on the past time history.
 *
 * <p>Caution - this is a simple, contrived example. This command essentially runs periodically the
 * hard way using memory of a time and a trigger on the time. There may be better ways to do that
 * simple scheduling structure, for example, the use of the "runBeforeCommands()" or
 * "runAfterCommands()" periodic methods as used for a sub-purpose here is a good way.
